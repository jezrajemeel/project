                <P>
In the heart of a quiet town nestled between sleepy hills and winding roads, lived an old man named Elias. His hair was silver, his hands trembled slightly, but his eyes—those deep, steady eyes—held a universe of memories.
Every morning, Elias sat by the window of his cottage, watching the world through thick-rimmed glasses. The townsfolk often wondered what he saw in the rustling trees or the fading mist. Children whispered stories about him: some said he could see the past, others believed he once had magic eyes that could tell truth from lies.
One rainy afternoon, a curious little girl named Lila crept up to his porch, holding a red umbrella too big for her small hands. Her eyes, wide with wonder, met his.

“Why do you always stare out the window?” she asked boldly.

Elias smiled, his face folding into lines carved by laughter and sorrow. “Because these old eyes remember,” he said.

“Remember what?”

He motioned for her to come closer, and she sat on the creaky wooden bench beside him. The rain tapped a soft rhythm on the roof.

“When I was your age,” Elias began, “I could see the world in colors that don’t exist anymore. Not the colors you see in your crayons, but ones that lived in moments—in people’s smiles, in their pain.”

Lila blinked. “That sounds like magic.”

“Maybe it was,” he chuckled. “Or maybe it was love.”

He told her about his wife, Mira, whose eyes were the color of stormy skies and who could silence a room with just one glance. They met in a bookshop, where she reached for the same novel he had his eyes on. From that moment, their lives became a shared story.

“But one day,” Elias said, his voice softening, “Mira’s eyes closed forever. And the world lost some of its color.”

Lila leaned her head on his shoulder. “That’s sad.”

“It is,” he nodded. “But I still see her. In the morning mist, in the pages of old books, and sometimes… in eyes like yours.”

She looked up at him, her small face puzzled. “Like mine?”

“Yes. Eyes that are brave enough to look and kind enough to see.”

Lila didn’t understand it fully, but she felt something warm bloom in her chest. She stayed until the rain stopped, and as she left, she turned to wave. Elias waved back, and for a moment, the lines on his face softened.

Years passed. Elias’s window stayed empty one morning, and the townspeople knew he had finally joined Mira. But Lila—now grown—returned often to sit by that bench.

And just like Elias, she watched the world with eyes that remembered.
